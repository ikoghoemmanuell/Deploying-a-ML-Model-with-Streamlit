# Building and Deploying a Machine Learning Model with Gradio

## Introduction

<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Klqn--Mu2pE/maxresdefault.jpg" width="150">

In this article, we will go through the process of building and deploying a machine learning model using Gradio. Gradio is an open-source Python library that enables you to quickly create custom interfaces for your machine learning models, allowing you to deploy them without needing to build a complete web application.

We will use a dataset that contains information about customer churn for a telecommunications company. Our goal is to build a model that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn or not. We will then create a Gradio interface that allows users to input customer data and get a churn prediction.

## üìÅ Dataset

Public dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

```python
numpy
pandas
sklearn
gradio
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started, you need to have [`Python3`](https://www.python.org/) on your system. Then you can clone this repo and being at the repo's `root :: friendly_web_interface_for_ML_models> ...` follow the steps below:

- Windows:

        python -m venv venv; venv\Scripts\activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt

- Linux & MacOs:
        python3 -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt

The both long command-lines have a same structure, they pipe multiple commands using the symbol **;** but you may manually execute them one after another.

1. **Create the Python's virtual environment** that isolates the required libraries of the project to avoid conflicts;
2. **Activate the Python's virtual environment** so that the Python kernel & libraries will be those of the isolated environment;
3. **Upgrade Pip, the installed libraries/packages manager** to have the up-to-date version that will work correctly;
4. **Install the required libraries/packages** listed in the `requirements.txt` file so that it will be allow to import them into the python's scripts and notebooks without any issue.

**NB:** For MacOs users, please install `Xcode` if you have an issue.

## üîß Building the Gradio App

We will use the Gradio library to create the app. The app will have input components such as dropdowns, sliders, and radio buttons. These components take in user input and store them as variables. We will also define an output component, which displays the churn prediction generated by the machine learning model.

## üöÄ Deploying the App

To deploy the app, we will use the Gradio deploy method. We will define the app object and then use the deploy method to launch the app. The deploy method takes in several parameters, such as the app object, the app name, and the app description.

## ‚ú® Conclusion

We have now built a Gradio app that predicts customer churn using machine learning. The app is simple to use and can be easily deployed to the cloud or integrated into a web application.
